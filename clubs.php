                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">The archery club allows people to practice recreational archery by shooting arrows at targets. The club also has the hopes of bringing in more people interested in the ancient and noble sport of archery for education and enjoyment for generations of future archers. Carrie Nilles is the advisor of the club and is responsible for the safety of the members of the club. The archery club focuses on shooting arrows at targets but in the event of an unfortunate accident, the club has officers who are trained in first aid and CPR. If newcomers get cold feet about joining because of their lack of skills, that would not be a problem because the archery club requires no experience to join. Archery can get easier if you keep trying and practicing. Some say that the archery club makes them feel like favorite fictional archery characters like Green Arrow, Hawkeye, Legolas, and many more.

The club encourages players to practice gaming with team members to prepare for Esports. The club also encourages the players to not keep trying even when theyâ€™re doing poorly at a game. The organization also prohibits toxic behavior, they do not want an organization member to curse at someone just because they made a mistake. Now there is some issue with the organization about some players losing their cool when another player makes a mistake and costs them the match. Members are required to bring their own controllers and headsets to participate in matches.</p>

                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshalls fencing club is a great way to relieve stress, make new friends, and learn to duel with swords. The club's goal is to preserve the art of fencing and to have fun with the sport. Club members are given protective gear to not get hurt in the act of fencing. Still, members are required to close-toed shoes, long pants, and gloves for protection. The organization teaches members to combine both the physical and mental strengths of each participant. Fencing is not a difficult sport, but it requires a lot of practice for people to be good at it. Beginners are always welcome, and no experience in fencing is required to join the club.</p>
