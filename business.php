                            <p class="mb-4 size-18">Located in Huntington, West Virginia, Marshall University’s Brad D. Smith Undergraduate School of Business offers a Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) degree in Economics and an area of emphasis in International Economics. Graduates of the Economics bachelor’s program add value to many types of organizations.

                        <h4 class="header-colorize">Why Study Economics at Marshall?</h4>
                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Economics is the study of choices that individuals, business and government entities make when allocating limited resources among alternative uses. For example, individuals must choose what goods or services to purchase with their limited incomes. Business firms must decide which goods to produce, how much to produce and what methods to use. Government bodies must choose which programs to implement and which taxes to levy.   </p>
                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Economists develop theories to explain how components of an economy operate and interact with one another. They then gather statistical and empirical evidence to estimate the relationships among the various aspects of the economy. Using this data, economists predict how different economic entities will respond to changes in policies and external forces. These predictions, in turn, help guide private and public decision-makers to form appropriate policies. </p>

                                  <p class="mb-4 size-18">Being well-prepared for the world of business is more important than ever, given how rapidly, as well as unexpectedly, circumstances can change. While we can’t predict the future, it is possible to build a solid foundation of business skills to have the right tools ready to effectively navigate change.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4 size-18">You can build this valuable foundation at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia. In Marshall’s well-respected Lewis College of Business (LCOB), the Brad D. Smith Undergraduate School of Business offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in General Business. Delivered 100% online, the BA in General Business degree is a unique way to learn and prepare for tomorrow’s volatile environment.</p>
                                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshall’s online bachelor’s in business degree does not require you to choose a major. Instead, you’re able to take 24 credit hours in any combination of upper-level LCOB classes, in addition to required courses in general education (34 credits) and the business core (42 credits). This means that for your business major, you can take classes in any of these areas and create your own major—management, marketing, accounting or economics/finance. Your goal is to build broad business knowledge to gain a professional advantage in a wide variety of careers.</p>

                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">The focus of Marshall’s online business major is on degree completion.

This program is geared toward nontraditional students including adult learners who have started a business degree but never finished it or students who cannot otherwise attend face-to-face classes.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshall’s General Business bachelor’s degree provides better value than a specialized degree if you hope to work in many different company departments, oversee various aspects of the business environment, and want to maximize your potential for career advancement.

                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">All students need to develop a global mind-set to be successful in business. The growth of international business has created a demand for people who have knowledge of global markets. By enrolling in an international business degree program in the Lewis College of Business, you will study topics that are directly related to global business including the politics, economics, and legal issues associated with doing business on an international scale. This will help you see how globalization has brought about an increasing ‘connectedness’ of businesses, markets, people and information across countries.</p>
