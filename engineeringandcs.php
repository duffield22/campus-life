                                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">You have always been fascinated by how and why things work. You’re curious about everything mechanical, from engines and machines to robotics and turbines. You want to be at the heart of designing and manufacturing products and systems essential to our everyday life.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Mechanical Engineering is one of the oldest and most versatile branches of engineering. As a discipline, Mechanical Engineering applies the fundamentals of engineering (based on physics, mathematics, chemistry and material science) to designing, innovating and fabricating mechanical, thermal or energy systems and devices.</p>
                                          <p class="mb-4 size-18">You can begin to build your expertise in this dynamic field by earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia.</p>
                                          <p class="mb-4 size-18">Taught by expert faculty in Marshall’s Weisberg Department of Mechanical Engineering, the major in Mechanical Engineering program integrates in-depth knowledge of core areas–mechanics, thermal science, material and manufacturing, control systems, and product design and development—with advanced studies in computing and physical sciences.</p>
                                          <p class="mb-4 size-18">This integration is critical for work in multidisciplinary areas such as bio- and manufacturing engineering, robotics and mechatronics, nanotechnologies and energy systems. Tools ranging from computer simulation and systems modeling to advanced experimental techniques are developed and applied in order to provide a solid understanding of fundamental phenomena, processes and system characteristics in these areas.</p>
                                  <h4 class="header-colorize">Why Study Mechanical Engineering at Marshall?</h4>
                                  <p class="mb-4 size-18">At Marshall, the primary goal of the bachelor of Mechanical Engineering program is solid technical training and knowledge that prepares BSME majors for a creative, lifelong engineering career. An innovative hands-on curriculum also focuses on developing students’ critical thinking skills, along with deepening their understanding of fundamental engineering principles. This background ensures Mechanical Engineering majors will be ready to tackle real-world engineering problems and challenges.</p>
                                  <h4>Accredited</h4>
                                  <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Mechanical Engineering bachelor’s degree program is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), confirming that the BSME program meets the quality standards of the Mechanical Engineering profession. At Marshall, class sizes and the faculty-to-student ratio for the Mechanical Engineering degree program are relatively small, ensuring that students receive personalized attention from their professors.</p>
