                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Founded at Yale University on December 6, 1845, Alpha Sigma Phi was founded upon five virtues: Charity, Honor, Purity, Silence, and Patriotism. Called the “Old Gal,” Alpha Sigma Phi was founded as a sophomore literary society but has grown to be much more. We push for academic and social excellence while fostering a meaningful brotherhood.</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">Alpha Sigma Phi’s motto is “To Better the Man” which is exactly what we strive to do here at Marshall University. Alpha Sigma Phi was founded at Marshall University in 1929. The brothers of the Beta Delta chapter hold us to the highest standards including, our academics and philanthropic opportunities in the Huntington community.</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">In the last years, the Beta Delta Chapter averaged a 3.0 GPA at Marshall University. Alongside this statistic, the Beta Delta chapter has served over 1,600 community service hours, benefiting service organizations. These organizations include, but are not limited to, Night to Shine Program, Ronald McDonald House, and Homes for Our Troops.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 size-18">Some of the most prestigious accolades the Beta Delta chapter has won include the Grandest Senior President (GSP) awards given to a single chapter. The GSP is awarded yearly to the most successful chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi. It deems Beta Delta the most successful Alpha Sigma Phi chapter worldwide. When the Beta Delta chapter isn’t serving the community, achieving in the classroom, or receiving awards, they enjoy the close brotherhood that our members have created. Some of the fun events we take part in are our Greek Week, Brotherhood Retreats, and intramural sports.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 size-18">Alpha Sigma Phi is the fastest growing fraternity nationwide and looking for those members who are striving for excellence in every facet of their lives. If you wish to find out more about Alpha Sigma Phi, please contact our Vice President of Recruitment, Kaden Short, at 304-910-8397.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">The mission of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated is to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity and friendship among college women, to study and help ease problems concerning girls and women to improve their social stature, to maintain a progressive interest in college life, and to be of “Service to All Mankind.”</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">The small group of women who organized the Sorority was conscious of a privileged position as college-trained women of color, just one generation removed from slavery. As the Sorority grew, balancing two essential themes: the importance of the individual and the strength of an organization of women of ability and courage. As the world became more complex, there was a need for associations which cut across racial, geographical, political, physical, and social barriers.</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">On November 18th, 1972, a group of women who exhibited the characteristics of Alpha Kappa Alpha women chartered the Eta Zeta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated on the campus of Marshall University. For 40 years, the Eta Zeta Chapter has maintained the values on a high pedestal by providing service to all mankind, excelling in the classroom, and exuding student leadership.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. is the first international fraternal organization founded on the campus of a historically Black college. The fraternity was founded on November 17, 1911, on the campus of Howard University. The founders were three undergraduates — Edgar Amos Love, Oscar James Cooper, and Frank Coleman. Joining them was their faculty adviser, Ernest Everett Just. From the Greek phrase, “Friendship is essential to the soul,” is derived from the name Omega Psi Phi. That phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance, and Uplift were adopted as Cardinal Principles.</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">There are many notable Omega Men recognized as leaders in the arts, the sciences, academics, athletics, business, civil rights, education, government, and science sectors at the local, national, and international levels.</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">Omega continues to flourish, largely because founders -- Cooper, Coleman, Love, and Just — were men of the highest ideals and intellect. The founders selected and attracted men of similar ideals and characteristics. It is not an accident that many of America’s great black men are or were Omega Men.</p>
