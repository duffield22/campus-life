Players win the game by either reducing their opponent’s life points to zero or less, or if the opponent is unable to draw a card when required. Members must be enrolled students at Marshall University to join, non-students may act as associate members, but may not vote or hold office. Members must have access to playable deck of Force of Will Cards to play, they cannot use another member’s deck. The club’s goal is to promote interest in Force of Will and to represent students an interest in strategy and use of the mind. The club offers a lot of different opportunities for fundraising, which must be passed by the president and the treasurer of the club, Zachary Wilson.</p>
