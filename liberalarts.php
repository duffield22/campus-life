                      <h4 class="header-colorize">What is Anthropology?</h4>
                          <p class="mb-4 size-18">From the Greek anthropos (“human”) and logia (“study”), anthropology is the study of humankind. For anthropologists, there are few limits on the scope of our inquiry—from distant human origins to the immediacy of our present day.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4 size-18">Though relatively easy to define, anthropology can be tough to describe. Its subject matter is both extraordinary (mortuary practices of the Toraja) and ordinary (anatomy of the human foot). Our focus can be sweeping (the development of language) and minute (use-wear patterns on a prehistoric obsidian tool). As an anthropologist, you may study ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, intravenous drug use in urban Appalachia or corporate culture in a U.S. car manufacturer.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">Anthropology provides an educational experience that people use to better understand and find their way in the increasingly complex and often divisive world that we live in today. Because of the integrative and holistic work anthropologists are doing around the world, the products and services people use every day are being designed better, limited environmental resources are managed more effectively, valuable cultural heritage and diverse languages can be preserved for future generations, and human lives are saved through improved healthcare delivery.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">Students pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, receive foundational training that reflects the scope of the discipline and may opt for one of the following emphases:</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">Sociocultural Anthropology Emphasis, Archaeological Anthropology Emphasis, Anthropology of Health Emphasis</p>
                      <h4 class="header-colorize">Why Study Anthropology at Marshall?</h4>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Anthropology bachelor’s degree program at Marshall University incorporates resources characteristic of departments at much larger universities, and no other anthropology degree program in West Virginia has a similar scope of tools available for faculty and student research.</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">Our affordable Anthropology degree program offers students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to thoroughly and creatively explore the world and peoples around them. Anthropology classes stress the exchange of ideas and build strength in critical thinking, communication and intellectual exploration. </p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">As a leading public research university, we ensure each of our Anthropology degree majors develops a solid foundation in the basic principles, theories and techniques of analysis within the discipline</p>

Latin is part of our everyday vocabulary; for instance, when you graduate from Marshall University, you’ll either be an alumnus (male) or an alumna (female).</p>
                                                    <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshall University, which is located in Huntington, West Virginia, offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Latin.</p>
                                                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">Studying Latin is an excellent foundation in the liberal arts and gives you the ability to read some of the world’s best literature, history and philosophy. Learning Latin helps with English grammar and prepares you to more easily learn other languages like Spanish.</p>
                                                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">The study of a foreign language like Latin also helps you develop critical thinking skills—increased powers of observation, analysis, logical reasoning, memory and adaptability—that are immediately transferable to other areas of higher education and to a diversity of careers.</p>
                                              <h4 class="header-colorize">Why Study Latin at Marshall?</h4>

                                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">At Marshall University, Latin is taught in an interdisciplinary environment that encourages students to explore adjunct fields, including art, art history, archaeology, architecture, engineering, Ancient Greek, history, philosophy and sociology.</p>

Two student organizations are especially relevant for Latin majors to foster social and academic activities: Marshall University Classical Association and Eta Sigma Phi, which is a national honorary association for the strengthening of classical learning throughout the United States.</p>

At Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, students in our Sociology undergraduate degree program pursue answers to, “Why do people do what we do?” and “How does society work?” Along the way, they also consider essential human questions like:</p>
                                                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">What does it mean to live in a socially constructed reality?</p>

                                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">In the Sociology department at Marshall, we look at sociology through many lenses. Humans are social beings and we live in a social environment. Sociology is the scientific discipline that studies that social environment, focusing on human behavior and social interactions of individuals, groups, organizations and whole societies.</p>
                                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Sociology is a science and was identified in the 1830s as one of the five “mother sciences,” along with astronomy, chemistry, physics and biology, and as such, overlaps with other social sciences. In our program, we maintain a unique, broad perspective that touches and incorporates all the others.</p>
                                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Sociology program at Marshall University allows you to study your interests in the workings of society with minimal disciplinary limits.</p>
                                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Our Sociology B.A. offers an excellent preparation for professional degrees or other advanced degrees. Our program seeks to ensure that each student develops a solid foundation in the principles, theories and techniques of analysis in the discipline.</p>
                                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">While allowing flexibility to accommodate students’ diverse interests, our curriculum ensures students are introduced to social theory, learn to employ the basic research methods of the discipline and take courses that provide a good orientation in the discipline—both in breadth and depth.</p>
                                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">In addition to earning their B.A. in Sociology at Marshall, students also can choose to obtain their Sociology master’s degree.</p>

                                                                <p class="mb-4 size-18">According to a 2017 Census report, an estimated 41 million Americans, over 13% of the population, speak Spanish at home. While increasingly spoken in the United States, Spanish remains an essential language in Latin countries in North, Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean Islands and Europe. Here in West Virginia, students can earn a bachelor’s degree in Spanish, or minors in the language, that leave them with better opportunities for jobs, as they are ready for interaction with international people from many different countries. Spanish gives Marshall graduates an edge in many fields such as business, health care, education, political science, various forms of media and communication, and many others.</p>
                                                                  <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Spanish bachelor’s program here at Marshall not only hones students’ Spanish language skills, but allows them to experience different cultures and develop critical thinking and their powers of observation, analysis, logical reasoning, memory and adaptability. All of these skills are immediately transferable to other areas of higher education and to a diversity of careers, at a time when gaining another view of the world and intercultural understanding is critical, both at the national and international levels.</p>

They also benefit from first-hand cultural experiences from different regions.</p>
                                                          <p class="mb-4 size-18">Students earning a B.A. in Spanish, or a Spanish minor participate in a faculty-led study abroad program. The Summer Madrid Spanish Language and Culture Program allows students to earn six hours of academic credit in a month (June or July) or 12 hours of academic credit in two months (June and July). They study at the Centro de Estudios Hispánicos with the Universidad Antonio de Nebrija in Madrid, Spain.</p>
