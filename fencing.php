                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshalls fencing club is a great way to relieve stress, make new friends, and learn to duel with swords. The club's goal is to preserve the art of fencing and to have fun with the sport. Club members are given protective gear to not get hurt in the act of fencing. Still, members are required to close-toed shoes, long pants, and gloves for protection. The organization teaches members to combine both the physical and mental strengths of each participant. Fencing is not a difficult sport, but it requires a lot of practice for people to be good at it. Beginners are always welcome, and no experience in fencing is required to join the club.</p>
