                          <p class="mb-4 size-18">Athletic trainers (ATs) are healthcare professionals who collaborate with physicians to provide preventive services, emergency care, clinical diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation of injuries and medical conditions. Athletic trainers are an integral part of healthcare in many clinical settings. The certified athletic trainer has the medical and physiological skills necessary to provide initial assessment and treatment of injury and the foresight to reduce the risk of their occurrence.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, offers a professional degree program that enables students to earn both a bachelor’s degree in Athletic Training and a master’s degree in AT through MU’s 3 + 2 plan. Students who already have a bachelor’s degree can just pursue the Master of Science in Athletic Training degree program.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Professional Master of Science in Athletic Training Program (PMSATP) is fully accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE).</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshall offers the only 3+2 combined Bachelor and Master of Science in Athletic Training program in the state of West Virginia. The standalone athletic trainer master’s program is also a perfect match for those who have earned a bachelor’s degree from another institution and who are seeking a master’s degree in Athletic Training.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshall offers a rigorous academic program in Athletic Training that blends classroom and laboratory instruction with clinical rotations where students complete required clinical education experiences with board-certified athletic trainers, physicians, physical therapists and other allied healthcare professionals.</p>
                      <h4 class="header-colorize">Why Study Athletic Training at Marshall?</h4>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Marshall University Athletic Training Program, offering a combined bachelor’s and master’s in five years, prepares students to sit for the national Board of Certification (BOC) exam [link to https://bocatc.org/candidates/steps-to-become-certified] for athletic trainers. This means Marshall students are eligible to take the BOC exam a year earlier in their education than students in competing programs at other schools. This reduces tuition costs, making Marshall one of the most affordable Athletic Training programs in the country, even for out-of-state students. Marshall University is also ranked the #1 Athletic Training program in West Virginia, according to Universities.com.</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">Marshall University offers a variety of clinical settings, both traditional and non-traditional, as well as a unique curriculum that prepares students to take and pass the national BOC exam. Recent PMSATP graduates have gained employment in a wide range of settings, including high school, college and professional athletics; outpatient clinics; industrial rehabilitation sites; physician practices; the performing arts; the military and safety settings.</p>
                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Athletic Training program features its own designated classroom and labs. The PMSAT program also uses the Marshall University Sports Medicine Institute, and the University’s biomechanics and exercise science labs. Marshall’s state-of-the-art motion labs offer a wide range of technology to allow students to conduct research at the undergraduate and graduate level.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4 size-18">Our Bachelor of Science in Biomechanics degree is designed to teach students foundational skills in kinesiology, exercise science and human physiology.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">The only one of its kind in West Virginia, our Biomechanics undergraduate program is one of less than 10 undergraduate programs across the country that offers a true bachelor’s degree in Biomechanics.</p>
                                <p class="mb-4 size-18">As a student pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Biomechanics at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, you will learn to measure limb movement, joint forces and muscle contractions during sports, exercise and daily life, using technology like video cameras, force plates and muscle sensors. You will learn to use measurements to make informed decisions about best practice to enhance performance, improve training, accelerate rehabilitation and reduce injury risk.</p>
                                <p class="mb-4 size-18">Biomechanics is a fast-growing healthcare-related field. If you choose to pursue a B.S. degree in Biomechanics, you can work in many different environments, from patient and athlete testing to product development.</p>
                                <p class="mb-4 size-18">The bachelor’s degree in Biomechanics can be a steppingstone degree, meaning it is flexible and does not restrict you to one career. Our students with a Biomechanics bachelor’s degree have attained graduate degrees in medicine, physical therapy, occupational therapy, chiropractic care, athletic training and more.</p>
                        <h4 class="header-colorize">Why Study Biomechanics at Marshall?</h4>
                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Our undergraduate program in Biomechanics will teach you to create work and life environments that improve human health and performance. Our students can work hands-on with specialized equipment each day, analyzing the body’s movements and identifying ways the body is not working efficiently.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">This knowledge is useful in a wide array of situations. For example, biomechanists test an athlete’s ability to generate torque because weakness at a particular point may increase the risk of injury.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">You will learn to identify modifications in technique or adjustments to training that can reduce the injury risk. Biomechanics students apply physics and mathematics to human body movement. Biomechanics majors are research-oriented and application-based, and our students become well-equipped in the study of ergonomics and human performance. </p>

                                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">Earning your bachelor’s degree in Health Sciences at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, will help you develop a strong foundation of core skills in preparation for a variety of health-related careers.</p>
                                  <h4 class="header-colorize">Why Study Health Sciences at Marshall?</h4>
                                  <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Health Sciences bachelor’s degree program has grown to include more than 400 students. Many Health Sciences students especially enjoy the flexibility of the program, including the ability to choose elective courses that focus on developing individual interests. Our Health Sciences degree allows students to prepare for and meet the requirements needed to reach their individual educational and career goals.</p>
                                  <p class="mb-4 size-18">Of the 120 credits required for graduation, 60 of the credits are elective and can be tailored to your particular areas of interest. For instance, a Health Sciences student interested in health care administration can take management and marketing courses as electives; another Health Sciences student interested in pharmacy can focus electives on chemistry courses.</p>
                                  <p class="mb-4 size-18">Core Health Sciences courses use active learning techniques that are highly engaging.
