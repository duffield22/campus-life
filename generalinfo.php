                      <p class="mb-4 size-18">A <strong>program</strong> is a series of courses or learning experiences that lead to a degree. At Marshall, an undergraduate degree program may offer more than one major, and it typically takes four years or 120 credit hours to complete a degree.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4 size-18">A <strong>major</strong> is a field of study that requires at least 24 credit hours for completion. A major can be offered within one department or a combination of departments. As part of a degree program, it has its own unique curriculum distinct from other majors.</p>
                          <p class="mb-4 size-18">An <strong>area of emphasis</strong> is a specific subject area of study with limited course offerings. An area of emphasis falls under a major within a degree program. A minimum of 12 credit hours can be expected for an area of emphasis at the undergraduate level</p>
