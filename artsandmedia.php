                          <p class="mb-4 size-18">The fields of Advertising and Public Relations are increasingly complex given the ever-changing impact of technology, new media, emerging communication channels and platforms, and more. Traditional functions in Advertising and Public Relations are paired with new realities in such areas as social media, web management, multimedia, video production and data management.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4 size-18">Professionals in Advertising and Public Relations require a strong foundation in skills and strategies to excel in today’s workplaces and be ready to adapt and grow successfully in the future. Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, fully prepares undergraduates for these dynamic career paths with the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Advertising and Public Relations.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">For majors who choose Advertising as their area of emphasis, the focus will be on a fast-paced, creative industry. This field is ideal for individuals who thrive on variety and relish new approaches and the latest trends. Advertising brings together analytical thinkers and imaginative creatives to work side by side to build relationships with consumers and provide useful information to those interested in what a company has to offer. Advertisers are the people responsible for message creation and brand building.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">As the other area of emphasis in this bachelor’s degree program, Public Relations serves a vital role in every business, nonprofit and organization. Public Relations is about raising a company’s authority and influence by building good relationships with clients and customers, stakeholders, the media, the community and investors. Practitioners in this field write news releases, articles, speeches and newsletters, engage in crisis management, conduct research, arrange events, plan PR campaigns and manage a variety of activities that direct a company’s reputation and image.</p>
                              <p class="mb-4 size-18">The Public Relations and Advertising major is part of the W. Page Pitt School of Journalism and Mass Communications (SOJMC). It is one of three schools operating within the College of Arts and Media. Students majoring in SOJMC’s programs constitute 44 percent of the college’s enrollment. The SOJMC has been nationally accredited since 1976 by the Accrediting Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communications; it was most recently reaccredited in 2015.</p>
